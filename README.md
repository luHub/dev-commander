# Super Calendar

Sometimes you need to have appointments for a "social cause" like birthdays but in a overcomplicated multipolar globally connected supply chain multitasked world and our busy life as "real-real" software developers recompiling a project between, pipelines, OCD code reviewers, patches, memes, useless conversations about one-space vs two-space linting that fascine your colleagues, and mediocre meetings with people that only like to listen to their own voice... We could forget about these important dates causing havoc in what we called "social relations". The addition of the overcomplicated cloud computing paradigm with REST, millions of libraries to print “Hello World” maintained by dudes in their parent's basements, the super compat compatible paradigm run-all-run-everywhere, GDPR, DevSecOps, 0 Trust networks, the global CO2 footprint cause, changing policies by cloud providers, social platforms, and the governments makes a "software calendar" a cumbersome project to build and a really expensive one to maintain compared to just memorize everything in your brain or forget all the dates and just don't care at all and give up. But there is one catch, don’t give up yet... The "Super Calendar" is here to save you, a state of the art tool to save your important appointments allowing you to be gracious, socially acceptable, even funny, and a possible candidate for mating or other activities without giving up in your super important busy life as SD(Software Developer) or whatever you want to be called that satisfy your ego or fantasies... To cut to the chase, You write the birthdates or appointments on a piece of a text file using your fingers methodically in a device called keyboard that is part of a personal computer or an attached device, and a practical extraction and reporting language (PERL) displays your appointments. 

### Text File
[B][Month][Date] #For Birthdates
[A][Year][Month][Date][Hour][Minute] #We include the year for the ones that like to plan life in 5 to 10 years in advance including dinners and going to the movies. 

#### Run the calendar in standard mode:

```
./dev_calendar.perl
```
