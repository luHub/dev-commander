# Super Calendar

Sometimes you need to have appointments for a "social cause" like birthdays but in a overloaded world with overcomplicated multipolar global supply chain multitasked processes and our busy life as "real-real" software developers recompiling a project between, pipelines, OCD code reviewers, patches, memes, pagers, chat messages, tickets, useless american psycho napiking conversations about one-space vs two-space linting for hours that fascinate your colleagues, and classical mediocre egotistic meetings with people that only like to listen to their own voice. We could forget about important dates causing havoc in what we called "social relations". The addition of the overcomplicated cloud computing paradigm with AI, blockchains, millions of libraries to print “Hello World” maintained by dudes in their parent basements, the super compat compatible paradigm, GDPR, Accessibility, DevSecOps practices, 0 Trust networks, the global CO2 footprint, changing policies by cloud providers, social platforms, and the governments makes a "software calendar" a cumbersome project and a really expensive one to maintain compared to just memorize everything in your brain which is difficult or forget all the dates, don't care at all and give up. But there is one catch, do not give up yet to be the one, the unique, the popular, the master, the coolest, the charismatic, the strong, the brave, the fierce, the armor, the knight, the eagle, the sharp, the objective, the captain of rough seas, the wise, the best, the winner... The "Super Calendar" is here for you, a state of the art tool to save your important appointments allowing you to be gracious, simple yet sofisticated, socially acceptable, and a possible candidate for mating or other activities without giving up on who you really are and your super important busy life as a RRSD(Real Real Software Developer) or whatever you want to be called that satisfy your ego or fantasies... To cut to the chase, You write the birthdates or appointments on a piece of a text file using your fingers methodically in a device called keyboard that is part of a personal computer or an attached device. Later, when you need it, a practical extraction and reporting language (PERL) using text transformations and advanced compiling techniques and concepts will display your appointments.

### The text file

Just place the cal.dcal file on the same folder of the dev_calendar.perl script

```
[B][Month][Date] #For Birthdates
[A][Year][Month][Date][Hour][Minute] #We include the year for the ones that like to plan life from 5 to 10 years in advance including dinners, going to the movies, and having babies. 
```

#### Run the calendar in standard mode:

```
./dev_calendar.perl
```


# SQCH PoC

All good things in life start with a PoC, not because we are lazy but because we think that if you don't write code is just bs.
So this one works as follows. Over time you end up typing commands to a console, over time you do the same ones, over and over. 
So dev_sqch.perl (sqch squanching) is here to PoC a way to link history to a "constellation" of commands.

```
history | dev_sqch.perl
```
